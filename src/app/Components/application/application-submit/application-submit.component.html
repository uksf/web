            <h4>Playstyle</h4>
            <p>Our operations are based on British Special Forces responsibilities.</p>
            <p>We consider ourselves hardcore military simulation in-game, and emulate British Military procedures
                as best we can.</p>
            <p>Debriefs are held after each operation, where performance is closely analysed and discussed.</p>
            <p>Each individual's game experience, the unit's collective game experience, and fun is always our first
                priority in UKSF. We cannot however provide the maximum expectation 100% of the time.</p>

            <h4>Dedication</h4>
            <p>UKSF was founded 10 years ago, and our leading members have been with us for 3+ years. We therefore
                focus on individuals who can offer long term dedication to the unit.</p>

            <h4>Days we play</h4>
            <p>Main operations are every Saturday at 7:45pm until late</p>
            <p>Training is every Wednesday at 7:45pm until ~10pm</p>
            <p>Side operations occur usually every day from ~7:30pm (These are not mandatory)</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Absence</h4>
            <p>Your personal life should always come before UKSF, however we do require notification if you are
                unable to attend Main Ops on Saturdays, and Training on Wednesdays.</p>
            <p>Our expectation is that you should be able to attend 3 Main Ops in a month.</p>
            <p>If you are unable to attend a Main Op, or are on holiday, you should submit a LOA through the website system.
            </p>
            <p>LOAs are only accepted until noon on the Saturday you cannot attend. LOAs posted after noon will
                not be counted, unless in the case of an emergency.
            </p>
            <p>If we do not receive a LOA before noon, you will be marked as absent for that Main Op. 3 absences
                in a row will result in a discharge, depending on the circumstances.

            <h4>Arma</h4>
            <p>You must own a legitimate copy of Arma 3.</p>
            <p>It is recommended you own APEX DLC as we occasionally run missions on Tanoa.</p>
            <p>Your system must be able to handle the game at more than vanilla performance, as our missions can
                be quite intensive.</p>

            <h4>Unit Rules & Attitude</h4>
            <p>UKSF does not allow dual-clanning. This is where you are actively a part of more than 1 milsim unit
                at a time.</p>
            <p>UKSF encourages proactivity.</p>
            <p>UKSF encourages being forward with your problems, ideas, suggestions, concerns, etc.</p>
            <p>UKSF expects a degree of maturity and common sense.</p>

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <p>Upon passing the application process, you will be moved to the Basic Training Unit.</p>
            <p>Basic Training consists of 4 phases, each of which you must pass before continuing to the next.</p>
            <p>Basic Training takes a minimum of 4 weeks. This depends on your attendance and instructor availability.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h4>Specialisation</h4>
            <p>Upon passing Basic Training, you will be moved to SFSG, where you can pursue any specialisation
                we have to offer.</p>
            <p>Specialisations include basic section qualifications such as gunner, marksman, AT, IBRU, advanced
                navigation, and IRS.</p>
            <p>Role specialisations require more training and the expectation of remaining in that role. These include
                NCO, Officer, Medic, RTO/FAC, and Sniper.</p>
            <p>Unit specialisations require the most training and result in a move to a different unit. The specialist
                units currently available include SAS and JSFAW.</p>
            <p>Our approach to training involves ensuring the trainee is capable of the role in both ability and
                attitude. Therefore, long-term specialisations are conditional based on these factors, and can
                take a number of months to achieve.</p>
